            <div class="opening">
            <p>Despite its sunny persona, tiki's history is far from welcoming and inclusive. First and foremost, tiki's U.S. representation conflates several Polynesian, Southeast Asian, and even Caribbean cultures - often sufferers of colonialism - into its singular vision. As a result, there is a misrepresentation, lack of credit, or historical impact acknowledgment of these unique audiences.

                Tiki kitsch reinforce stereotypes and emphasize exoticism. Modern tiki often rebrands as a broader "tropical" theme, recognizing this fraught history. Simply replacing tiki mask mugs with palm leaf designs is not a cure-all, though.

                A new generation of bar owners and spirits specialists brings new life,  diversity, and understanding to this genre. </p>

Bar owners Kyisha Davenport, Sāsha Coleman, and Ellie Tiglao are reinvigorating tiki by "infusing their tiki drinks with deeper meaning and stories," an evolution they call Afro-Tiki. Through food, drink, and conversation, their vision centers on Black and Brown voices to shed light on these marginalized and often forgotten contributions to tiki.</p>
